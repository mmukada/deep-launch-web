    <h2>WORK EXPERIENCE</h2>
    <h3>NatWest Markets - Contract Software Engineer (May 2021 - June 2023)</h3>
    <span class="intro">
    Worked on Risk applications aimed at complying with the FRTB
    regulation. These Scala + Spark applications are hosted on GCP, with DataProc, BigQuery, Cloud SQL, PubSub, Cloud
    Logging, and Cloud Storage being the primary stack. Features include data mining, trade and market risk
    analysis, stress-testing PL data, and regulatory reporting.
    </span>
    <ul>
        <li>Implemented calculation orchestration engines in Spark that leverage native libraries via JNI. Critical sections were cleanly guarded by employing concurrency techniques such as Read-Write locks. Output was routed via PubSub to the persistence service.</li>
        <li>Optimized a Scala + Spark application by minimizing memory usage, resulting in an 87% reduction
            in resource consumption. This was achieved by utilizing
            real-time monitoring with a memory profiler (Visual VM), capturing heap dumps, and analyzing them using the
            Eclipse Memory Analyzer Tool (MAT). I presented the techniques to the programme for wider adoption.
        </li>
        <li>Contributed to the development of mediating containerized Java microservices responsible for assembling and dispatching
            calculation requests via a REST API, as well as processing asynchronous progress updates.
        </li>
        <li>Contributed to a QA automation suite that conducts end-to-end tests to test for functional regression.
        </li>
        <li>Refined VM initialization scripts to ensure deterministic initialization of services and
            alignment with logging best practices - e.g. compression, rotation, and purging. Used Terraform alongside Bash scripts
        </li>

    <h3>Lloyds Bank - Contract Software Engineer (Jan 2021 - May 2021)</h3>
    <span class="intro">
    Worked on Scala + Spark backend applications responsible for processing insurance data to
    generate reports for the IFRS17 regulation. The fronting ingestion Java components leveraged Apache Ignite, relaying to the backend via Spark Streaming.
    </span>
    <ul>
        <li>Implemented pipelines for ingesting ledger and reference data, computing and curating derivative
            datasets for report generation and visualization. These processes leveraged Spark Streaming to read from the fontend, and KAFKA to house the intermediate results across the calculation hierarchy.
        </li>
        <li>Enhanced the Java ingestion modules to handle dynamic metadata represented as JSON headers embedded within
            CSV data files. The metadata was propagated and materialized as dynamic columns in the respective target Phoenix tables.
        </li>
        <li>Prescribed the algorithm for a generic data enrichment framework that leverages Scala + Spark dataframes. The
            architecture patterned a tree representation, with leaf nodes representing input sources and branch nodes
            encapsulating the merge and enrichment logic.

    <h3>Royal Mail - (Feb 2017 - Jul 2018), Contract Software Architect / Developer</h3>
    <span class="intro">
    Worked as a Software Architect and lead Engineer, bridging the gap between the Data Science and Data Engineering teams. My role involved translating our Data Scientist's machine learning models
    into scalable production prototypes. This encompassed handling the architecture and prototype development, eventually passing onto the Data Engineering team for concrete implementation. Primary technologies
    were Scala, Spark, and Python, hosted on Microsoft Azure.
    </span>
    <ul>
        <li>Introduced the containerized microservice paradigm to decompose the firm's algorithms into reusable services. This encompassed leveraging Docker and Kubernetes</li>
        <li>Architected a generic data ingestion and visualization framework to seamlessly onboard
            data sources and datasets for analysis by the business. I leveraged Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, and RDBMS.
        </li>
        <li>Led the rewrite of an IoT backend Spark application used for tracking postmen and computing derivative datasets for
            business analyses and route optimizations. The redesigned solution significantly improved maintainability and performance, reducing
            runtime from 10 hours on a 20-node cluster to 30 minutes on 2 nodes.
        </li>
        <li>Architected a distributed ad hoc delivery route optimization engine using the Large Neighborhood
            Search algorithm, aiming to handle concurrent processing across hundreds of delivery hubs. AKKA, Scala, Docker and
            Kubernetes were utilized.
        </li>
        <li>Designed and prototyped an enhanced and more accurate version of the 'Estimated Delivery Window' application. This leverages GPS
            data from postmen's PDAs to improve static-route traversal prediction accuracy. It replaced the original version based on regression algorithms
            exercised on sparse and minimal historical delivery events.

    <h3>Goldman Sachs - Contract Software Engineer (Jan 2015 - Feb 2017)</h3>
    <span class="intro">
    Worked on a Regulatory Reporting and Trade Reconciliation tiered application
    utilizing Java, Hadoop, Spark, and Scala. The tiers were a componentization of the different phases of the processing flow into cohesive modules.
    </span>
    <ul>
        <li>Designed the Java module that ingests trade submission reports sourced from the Regulator into Hadoop. Overcame
            the challenge of processing deeply malformed CSV files, transforming them into Avro files in HDFS for
            downstream processing. Avro was the natural choice to accommodate schema evolution.
        </li>
        <li>Refactored, enhanced, and parallelized a downstream Java module responsible for generating derivative
            projections of the curated trade reports for analytic and reconciliation flows. Employed advanced concurrency techniques such as Phasers to mimic count up/down latches.
        </li>
        <li>Reimplemented the module for generating a compacted corpus of trade submissions (to the regulator). This
            involved rewriting and migrating the implementation from Hive scripts to Spark + Scala. This reduced execution
            time from 2 hours to 15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Designed and developed a multithreaded Java application for collecting metrics from HA Proxy instances that
            fronted document store services. The collected metrics were then submitted to a bespoke application for
            charting and analysis.
        </li>
        <li>Designed and implemented a Scala application for cross-cluster data copying and synchronization in Hadoop.
        </li>
        <li>Revised an ingestion pipeline responsible for sourcing data from Elasticsearch into Hadoop to generate business reports. Adopted a REST-centric approach, moving away from a deprecated
            Java API.

    At Hotels.com, an Expedia company specializing in online hotel booking, I worked on the server-side integration
    team, building Java microservices to source data from external providers and generate derivative content for the
    frontend UI. Services were exposed via REST+JSON endpoints. Upstream consumption was via REST and SOAP services.
    </span>
    <ul>
        <li>Designed a distributed cache powered by Cassandra to store hotel data fetched from content providers via SOAP webservices.</li>
        <li>Implemented a data loader that populated guest reviews and pricing data into a Solr index. These data
            loaders, written in Java, pre-populated the Solr search indices with hotel content summaries to power search functionalities and filtering.
        </li>
        <li>Introduced Spring Integration to simplify the architecture of our suite of applications.</li>
        <li>Implemented pricing strategies tailored for different geographic regions to align with business and
